# Additions
## Items
- Glass Shards, which drop when breaking glass and glass panes. Four shards can be crafted back into a glass block.
- Sulfur, mined from ore, which can be crafted with charcoal to create a peaceful source of gunpowder.
## Combat
- `collections:generic.attack_reach`, a new attribute which controls how far away the player can attack mobs from.
  - Tools have a `Combat Reach` modifier that changes this attribute
# Changes
## Aesthetic
- Re-textured dirt/grass related blocks to their Minecraft Dungeons textures
- Re-textured music discs to actually look good
- Campfires, when extinguished, no longer have ash in order to make building with them easier
- Soul Campfires have soul soil as ash
- Helmets that have a nose guard on the player now reflect that in the item texture
- Leather armor no longer has un-dyed sections, as those make the armor look bad
- Arrows now have a flint tip to more accurately reflect the crafting recipe

  - (Pro-tip, the bowl is not nutritious)
